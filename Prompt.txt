# Steps
## Step 1: Start Your Project
**Chatbot:**

## Step 3: Work in Stages
**Chatbot:**  
"I recommend dividing the project into smaller stages. At the end of each stage, we’ll review progress and check if we’re still on track. Ready for Stage 1?"

## Step 4: Monitor Progress
**Chatbot:**  
"I’m tracking the project. Here’s the status: Are we within time, cost, and scope limits? If something exceeds tolerances, I’ll notify the Project Board for guidance."
