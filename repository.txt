A repository of PRINCE2 templates and examples would provide users with pre-defined or adaptable resources for their projects, helping them to quickly implement the methodology. PRINCE2 uses various **management products** to support each of its practices, and templates for these documents can save project teams time and effort. The key management products that would be included in such a repository are:

*   **Business Case:** This document justifies the project and is continuously reviewed throughout the project. A template would include sections for outlining the project's objectives, benefits, costs, and risks. Example completed business cases could be provided for different types of projects.
*   **Risk Register:** This document keeps track of all project risks. Templates include columns for risk identification, assessment, and mitigation. Examples would show how to classify risks and assign responsibility for managing them.
*   **Issue Log:** This document records any relevant event that has happened, was not planned, and may affect project outcome. Templates would include fields for describing the issue, its impact, and actions taken to address it.
*   **Project Plan:** This plan outlines how the project will be executed. A template would include sections for detailing project timelines, resources, and budgets. Examples might show different project plans for different project sizes and complexities.
*   **Product Description:** This document defines the required characteristics of project products, focusing on quality. Templates would include sections for describing the product's purpose, functionality, and quality criteria.
*  **Work Package Description**: This document provides a set of information that is passed to the team managers. Templates would include fields for describing the work to be carried out, timescale, and quality requirements.
*   **Checkpoint Reports**: These are regular updates on project progress. Templates would include sections for reporting on current stage, task completion, risks, and issues.
*   **Highlight Reports**: These provide a high-level overview of the project status. Templates would include fields to report on overall project status, key risks, and issues.
*   **Exception Reports:** This report documents any deviations from project tolerances. Templates would include fields for describing the exception, its impact on the project, and possible corrective actions.
*   **Sustainability Management Approach**: This document outlines the planned approach to sustainability within the project. Templates would include fields for recording key actions, and ways of measuring the success of the approach.
*   **Digital and Data Management Approach:** This document describes the approach to managing digital aspects and data within the project. Templates would include sections for planning the management of data, and data security within the project.
*   **Project Log**: A record of project activities. Templates would include fields for recording daily activity and progress, in addition to risks, issues, and other management activities.
*   **Lessons Log:** This log records lessons learned during the project and refers to past projects to improve future project. Templates would include sections for describing the lesson, its impact, and recommendations for future projects.

These templates would be valuable in supporting the **seven practices** of PRINCE2: Business Case, Organization, Quality, Plans, Risk, Issues, and Progress. By providing these, the repository helps ensure that project teams apply the methodology effectively and consistently. The templates and examples could also include guidance on how to **tailor** PRINCE2 to projects of different sizes and complexities. This is because PRINCE2 is designed to be flexible, allowing project managers to adapt processes and documentation to fit the specific needs of their projects. Such a repository could also include examples of how PRINCE2 can be integrated with other techniques like Kanban boards and Gantt charts.
